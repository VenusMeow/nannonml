# The board representation is as follows: a tuple composed of two tuples, e.g.:
#     ((0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 2)) --> starting position in Nannon {6, 3, 6}
#
#     ((0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 2)) == R<RR--BB>B
#
# Where
#     1. The left tuple corresponds to the current player
#     2. The right tuple corresponds to the inactive player
#     3. The length of each inner tuple is n_chex
#     4. The value of each inner tuple's elements is in range(0, n_pos + 1)
#     5. Each value corresponds to a piece's board position,
#         from its owner's perspective.
#     6. The values of each inner tuple must appear in sorted order.
